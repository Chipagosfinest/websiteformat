title: About Me
---

Prior to my delving into Software Development, I was a Computational Designer, my primary job was to design and coordinate design/tech solutions to various projects

I scripted in applications that focused on parametric solutions on various projects and installations, I became more intrested in how the internal workings of software and from there on lead to my life-long journey to understand and learn about programming software.
I still very much in love with deisgning and hope to transition from once a Built-Environment Architect to a Software Architect.


Some fun facts about me:

* Avid fan of speedcubing!
* Science fiction buff
