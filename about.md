title: About Me
---

Prior to diving into software development, I was a Computational Designer. My primary job was to design and coordinate design/tech solutions to various projects.

I scripted in applications that focused on parametric solutions on various projects and installations. I became more interested in how the internal workings of software worked. From there opened a door of curiosity to my life-long journey to understand and learn about programming software.

Still, Iâ€™m very much in love with designing and hope to transition from a Built-Environment Architect to a Software Architect.

Some fun facts about me:
Avid fan of speedcubing!
Science fiction buff
