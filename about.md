Hi! My name is Ismail Kalimi. I am a Full Stack Software Engineer living in Chicago. I work on React on Rails, coding away every day in my pain stakingly crafted environment. :D

Prior to diving into software development, I was a Computational Designer. My primary job was to design and coordinate design/tech solutions to various projects.
I scripted in applications that focused on parametric solutions on various projects and installations. I became more interested in how the internal workings of software worked. From there opened a door of curiosity to my life-long journey to understand and learn about programming software.

Still, Iâ€™m very much in love with designing and hope to transition from a Built-Environment Architect to a Software Architect.

Some fun facts about me:

* Avid fan of speedcubing!
* Science fiction buff
* Fish Shell User
* Vim thumper

Have questions ? Feel free to reach me on ismail@kalimi.net

Thanks for reading!
