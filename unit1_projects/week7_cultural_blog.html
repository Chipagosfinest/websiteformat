        <h1>Stereotype Threat</h1>

        <section>
<p>Wikipedia defines Stereotype threat as the experience of anxiety in a situation in which a person has the potential to confirm a negative stereotype about his or her social group which can lead to hindering their ability to perform at their best.</p>

<p>Stereotyping is widely evident whether it be positive or negative. People tend to be stereotypical about a group's gender, race or religion.
The anxiety the person feels because of this stereotype can lead to various insecurities and self doubt.</p>

<p>How can we reduce this stereotype of groups ?
Well I guess whether we like it or not it will always be there, but with communication and awareness, getting to know the people, would go a long way helping us remove such boundaries.</p>
