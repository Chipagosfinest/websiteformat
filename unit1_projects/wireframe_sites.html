        <h2><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a></h2>
        <p>HHacker news is another news aggregator site that I frequent, this site is specifically tailored for programmers and developers. It is maintained by Y combinator, the same people who fund start ups. It approaches the news content through a minimalist view, the links are only a few sentences long and directs to the original site.</p>
