        <h2>The Verge</h2>
        <p>A technology news website, the verge is designed to maximize readability, it focuses on high quality images and videos and minimalistic titles to keep the user/reader engaged, the clean look of the website, non intrusive ads and easy navigation is the reason I keep coming back to it.</p>
