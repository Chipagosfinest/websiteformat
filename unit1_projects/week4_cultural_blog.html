        One of the most prominent conflicts I faced was when I got into an argument with one of my friends, to call him a friend would actually be a stretch more of an acquaintance, I met him through a mutual group of friends and we were playing a friendly game of facts and figures questionnaire and I was considerably doing better than this "friend", Now when I think about it I am pretty sure he did not like that he was losing and thats why he suddenly brought up a topic that I was quite sensitive with, and though the group knew and I am pretty sure that so did he that I was not comfortable with it, he insisted on keep talking and raising issues with it, finally I lost my temper and ended up arguing with him (which was what he was looking to do), eventually we both stormed off and everyone was left in a sour mood.

        After passing of a few days, I came to realize that I shouldn't have reacted the way I did, and should've handled the situation better. I even tried to reach out to the person but the relation between us was never the same, and he avoided me since then.
        <br>
        <br>
        My actions definitely made the conflict worse, instead of managing and properly addressing the issue, anger overcame me and I lost my cool.
        <br>
        <br>
        If I could go back i definitely would've tried to reason with him and sort it out.
        <br>
        <br>
        I learned that the main reason he started to lash out at me was not actually because he didn't like me or has some problem with me but the way I made him feel about himself and should've done something to address that. So I guess it all comes down to empathy and realizing how the other person is feeling.
