        After passing of a few days, I came to realize that I shouldn't have reacted the way I did, and should've handled the situation better. I even tried to reach out to the person but the relation between us was never the same, and he avoided me since then.
        <br>

        <br>
        My actions definitely made the conflict worse, instead of managing and properly addressing the issue, anger overcame me and I lost my cool.
        <br>
        <br>
        If I could go back i definitely would've tried to reason with him and sort it out.
        <br>
        <br>
        I learned that the main reason he started to lash out at me was not actually because he didn't like me or has some problem with me but the way I made him feel about himself and should've done something to address that. So I guess it all comes down to empathy and realizing how the other person is feeling.
