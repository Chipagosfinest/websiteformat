                <br>nobody can deny that the ageism is something of a problem in tech industry,
                <br>
                <br>People who discriminate on age like to tell themselves that young people can pickup technologies far more faster than their older counterparts, and the managers prefer to have young emplyees working for them because the hours they dictate is hours accepted by the younger crowd, since young people have far less commitments than a middle aged person who has kids, mortage and other obligations
                <br>this is actual quote from the famous Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg,
                <br>“Young people are just smarter”
                <br>Is this really true ? Whats more sad is some of the engineers working in the industry believe such a ludicrous thought that showing or acting old will be perceived negatively.
                <br>Ofcourse it worries me that how what about the older
