                <br>Nobody can deny that the ageism is something of a problem in tech industry,
                <br>
                <br>There have been numerous articles where people felt discriminated against because of their age and either took appropriate action or were let go after years of service just because the culture of this industry has this gross perception that being young and hip equals success.
                <br>
                <br>Maybe people who discriminate on age like to tell themselves that young people can pickup technologies faster than their older counterparts, and maybe managers prefer to have young emplyees working for them because the hours they dictate is accepted by the younger crowd, since young people have far less commitments than a middle aged person who has kids, mortgage and other obligations to worry about.
                <br>this is actual quote from the famous Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, “Young people are just smarter”
                <br>
                <br>Is this really true ? Whats more sad is some of the engineers working in the industry believe such a ludicrous theory, and that showing or acting old will be perceived negatively, and they go out have procedures and surgeries done on them just to look young. It's just baffling.
                <br>I remember there was a time being old was considered wise and knowledgable, and I for one still believe in that, experience and expertise gained through years is far more important than having few years to your name.
