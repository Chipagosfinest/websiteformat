                <br>nobody can deny that the tech industry has become a young mans game,
                <br>well thats what people would like to think, that young people can pickup technologies far more faster than their older counterparts, at least thats what the majority of the tech magnates think,
                <br>this is actual quote from the famous Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg,
                <br>“Young people are just smarter”
                <br>Is this really true ? Whats more sad is some of the engineers working in the industry believe such a ludicrous thought that showing or acting old will be perceived negatively.
                <br>Ofcourse it worries me that how what about the older
