            <p>I commend Shereef for making such an awesome learning environment, DBC is not  only for learning the technical aspect of programming but how it is actually used in real world and in real world people collaborate.
                <br>
                <br>Before joining DBC, I actually had enrolled in month long Java course to make my self acquainted with the language, and the course had a totally opposite learning mentality compared to DBC, it did not foster any pair programming or being transparent with tutors, in the end everyone suffered. The part where each person pushes the other to become the best reinforces my decision of joining DBC and this is the experience I am looking for.</p>
