                Essentially everything in ruby is a object or class, anything can be called upon to see what class they belong to.
                <br>Examples:
                <br>
                <br>p 3.class => Fixnum
                <br>p "Hello World".class => String
                <br>p [1,2,3].class => Array
                <br>p hash = {'a'=>1,'b'=>2}.class => Hash
                <br>
                <br>So basically all the methods we are using for objects in ruby and defined in the classes of those objects.
                <br>A simple example would be the capitalize method in the String Class.
                <br>Now we know its a Class so basically this would be the syntax for it
                <br>
                <br>class String
                <br>def capitalize
                <br>self[0].upcase + self[1..-1]
                <br>end
                <br>end
                <br>

                <br>Now upcase is also a method of the String class, but you get my point.

                <br>
                <br>the syntax for creating a instance object from a class goes like
                <br>
                <br>obj-name = class-creating-from.new(*agruments)
                <br>Example:
                <br>game = Chess.new(black)
                <br>


            </p>
