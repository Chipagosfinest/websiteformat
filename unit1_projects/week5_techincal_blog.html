            <br>While both arrays and hashes can be used to store values, hashes are bit rigid in the terms of indexing, that is it is structured in a way to have a ordered list, each value in a hash has to have a corresponding key to it, and in a hash a key cannot be repeated.
            <br>
            <br>
            Where as if you take a look at Arrays they are basically values which you can return using a index value, and each value in an array would have a index value corresponding to it. But one can easily change the values order and its corresponding index value would change too.
            <br>
            <br>
            In a ruby hash one can sort the hash either by a key or value, versus in an array it will sort by the data it holds.
            <br>
            <br>
            Example a simple Hash would look like something like this
            <div style="background: #000000; overflow:auto; width:auto; margin: 0 auto; padding: 20px;">
            <span style = "color:white;">
            <p>
            hash = {
            0 => “A”,
            1 => “B”,
            2 => “C”,
            3 => “D”,
            4 => “E”,
            5 => “F”,
            6 => “G”
            }
            </p>
            </span>
            </div>
            <br>
            and one can retrieve the keys and values either by 
            using the hash.keys and hash.values methods or the values by using the hash[key] notation or also by using the .each method and retrieving either the key, value or both.
            <br>
            <br>
            Here is simple Array
            <br>
            <div style="background: #000000; overflow:auto; width:auto; margin: 0 auto; padding: 20px;">
            <span style = "color:white;">
            <p>
            array = [0,1,2,3,'a','b','c']
            </p>
            </span>
            </div>
            One can retrieve the values by using the array.index_at or by simply using array[index_number] notation.
            </p>
