            <h3>The Verge</h3>
            <p>Extrememly helpful and entertaining site. I get all my newest tech and gadget reviews from here.<br>The way verge is designed, the images are the first thing that catches your eye and then the simple non-instrusive titles are easy to read and navigate through.<br>The Verge I would describe as Visually Stunning and Elegant<br></p>

            <h3>Lifehacker</h3>
            <p>Lifehacker provides helpful tips and tricks for practically all aspects of life. Whether is some, time-saving techniques or productivity enhancing applications. I especially like the Top downloads and other recurring posts. Though the site could do better in terms of visual design, the look of the website is clean and uncluttered.</p>

            <h3>Hacker News</h3>
            <p>Hacker news, works a lot like the popular social/news website, Reddit, the users upvote links to the top of the page and it has a system of points just like karma in reddit, the two websites do share some of the visual aspects of web design but unlike reddit, HN is all work, it focuses on topics/articles on software development and tech news. The plain minimalist look suites HN and I wouldnâ€™t change it a bit.</p>
