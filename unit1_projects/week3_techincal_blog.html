            <p>JavaScript has become the de facto standard for front end development, since javascript is supported by almost all of the browsers, it can deliver the same performance and user experience without the constraint of browser compatibility.
                <br>
                <br>Iâ€™ll just give you a brief into its technical history, it was built by Brendan Eich in 1995 when he had to ship the language to work in netscape, they used the name JavaScript to ride on the name of Java which was making rounds in the software development circle at that time, and rightly so because Java is still being very much used till today, and the number is only increasing.
                <br>
                <br>Though there are some glaring errors that are present in the javascript language *see JavaScript wat talks?*(one of my favorite videos), because of its extensive reach to the browsers many tools like coffee script have come along a long way upon improving it.
                <br>
                <br>One does not have to look far to see that javascript is one of the most popular languages to be working in right now, With already established frameworks like angular, ember and backbone and new frame works like famo.us and d3.js its just beginning and impressive to see how much more javascript can accomplish and with the introduction of Node.js, the javascript is not limited to front end development either, many large organizations are looking to invest their time and money to transfer over their backend work to javascript.
                <br>
                <br>The world of development, almost everything is moving to the web and the front runner that is making it happen is JavaScript.
                <br>
                <br>Just recently a post on HackerNews was written the number of commits that is being contributed to JavaScript out matches every other language.</p>
