Having been on continous path to improve my work flow, I recently took upon myself to learn Vim.

Vim is a very powerful modal text editor, and like all UNIX tools it does its singular job of editing text really well.

One of the most amazing features I use to edit text in Vim is its moving between the text of the file, turning on the relative line numbers was a game changer for me.
I could easily see the line number on the right and to corresponding line with ``<N><J or K>```
My vimrc is available on GitHub
